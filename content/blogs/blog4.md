# Background
I was born and raised in a small town close to Vienna where I spent most of my life. During junior high school I lived in Sicily for two years but decided to return to Vienna to finish secondary school there. After graduating from the [commercial high school](https://floridsdorf.vbs.ac.at/) in 2017, I decided to complete my community service at the ambulance, where I worked as a paramedic for 9 months. Due to my prior business education and the internships I completed during that time, I decided to study Finance where I ended up pursuing a Bachelor's degree at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/) and now a Master's degree at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/).

# Passion
When it comes to my interests, I could write about many different things. I'm very passionate about sports in general and I also like to try out new ones. I also enjoy spending my free time outdoors where i usually spend time with my friends or meet new people. I also love to travel to learn about new cultures and interesting places but also to collect some exciting memories. Last but not least, I am always happy to discuss and follow developments in finance, entrepreneurship, politics, economics, sustainability and technology.
