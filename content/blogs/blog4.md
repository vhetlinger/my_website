# Background
I was born and raised in a small town close to Vienna where I spent most of my life. During junior high school I lived in Sicily for two years but decided to return to Vienna to finish secondary school there. After graduating from the [commercial high school](https://floridsdorf.vbs.ac.at/) in 2017, I decided to complete my community service at the ambulance, where I worked as a paramedic for 9 months. Due to my prior business education and the internships I completed during that time, I decided to study Finance where I ended up pursuing a Bachelor's degree at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/) and now a Master's degree at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/).

# Interests
When it comes to my interests, I could write about many different things. I'm very passionate about sports in general and I also like to try out new ones. I also enjoy spending my free time outdoors where i usually spend time with my friends or meet new people. I also love to travel to learn about new cultures and interesting places but also to collect some exciting memories. Last but not least, I am always happy to discuss and follow developments in finance, entrepreneurship, politics, economics, sustainability and technology.

# Aspirations
In the course of my academic career, I have had the opportunity to complete a number of internships ranging from start-ups to large multinational corporations as well as investment banks and management consultancies. All these experiences were very valuable to better understand how my career entry should look like later on. What I realized is that I am particularly interested in strategic projects with a clear finance focus. I also hope to find a role where I can collaborate as part of a team and where I can contribute within a project-based work environment. For this reason, during my time at London Business School, I will be applying for positions that meet these requirements.
